#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Two**, I created a local Database in order to deal with offline first approach and serve restaurants information even if there is no riliable network connection. Additionally, I've improved accessibility and app performance.

In **Stage Three**, I've added a review form that a user can submit. The form was created by the Offline-first approach and handles form submission even if the user is offline. Additionally, the user can mark restaurants as favourite.
The client sends GET,PUT and POST requests to the server.

The **Restaurant Reviews App** was build with all the approaches I've learned through out the nano degree such as:
Responsiveness, Accessibility, Performant based and Offline-first approach.
